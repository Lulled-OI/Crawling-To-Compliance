## Learning Entries

### Date: [TODAY'S DATE]
**Focus**: AWS S3 Security Setup
**Time**: [X hours]
**Done**:
- [x] Set up GitHub repository structure
- [ ] Research S3 security best practices
- [ ] Create test bucket configurations
- [ ] Build out documentation

**Learned**:
- Block public access by default is crucial
- Different S3 encryption options: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C
