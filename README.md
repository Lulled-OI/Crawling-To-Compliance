# Crawling-To-Compliance üõ°Ô∏è

**Cybersecurity GRC Learning Lab**

Learning cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance through hands-on AWS labs and practical exercises. Starting from the basics and working up to more complex implementations.

## What I'm Learning

- **Governance**: Security policies, procedures, and organizational frameworks
- **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements and industry standards

## Current Progress

### Phase 1: AWS Security Basics
- [ ] S3 Bucket Security Configurations
- [ ] IAM Policy Implementation
- [ ] CloudTrail Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Security Group Management

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment
- [ ] Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis
- [ ] Risk Register Development
- [ ] Threat Modeling Exercises
- [ ] Business Impact Analysis

### Phase 3: Compliance Frameworks
- [ ] NIST Cybersecurity Framework Implementation
- [ ] ISO 27001 Controls Mapping
- [ ] SOX IT Controls Documentation
- [ ] Audit Preparation and Evidence Collection

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lulled-OI/Crawling-To-Compliance.git
   cd Crawling-To-Compliance
   ```

2. **Set up AWS CLI** (for AWS labs)
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Start with S3 Security Labs**
   ```bash
   cd aws-labs/s3-security
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Learning Only**: All configurations and vulnerabilities are for educational purposes
- **No Real Data**: Test environments only - never use production or sensitive data
- **Watch Costs**: Monitor AWS usage to avoid unexpected charges
- **Security Warning**: Some configurations are intentionally vulnerable - never use in production

## Progress Tracking

See [docs/learning-log.md](docs/learning-log.md) for detailed progress notes.
